# AQI-DATA ANALYSIS

resentation Theme: “Decoding India's Air Quality Post-COVID (2022 Onwards) – A Data-Driven Review”
📌 1. Which cities are the most and least polluted in India?
Insight:

Most Polluted City: Byrnihat (AQI: 284.19)

Least Polluted City: Tirunelveli (AQI: 33.29)

Interpretation:

A wide disparity in AQI indicates the need for localized air quality policies.

Byrnihat's high AQI requires urgent air purification interventions.

📌 2. What are the weekday vs. weekend AQI patterns in major metro cities?
Insight:

Cities like Delhi show a decrease of AQI on weekends (Weekday: 209, Weekend: 199, Δ = -10).

Chennai shows negligible difference.

Interpretation:

Traffic and industrial activity significantly contribute to weekday pollution.

Insights like this help target pollution control for weekdays.

📌 3. Which are the top 5 most and least polluted areas?
Top 5 AQI Areas:

Byrnihat

Delhi

Hajipur

Bahadurgarh

Gurugram

Bottom 5 AQI Areas:

Chamarajanagar

Vijayapura

Palkalaiperur

Madikeri

Tirunelveli

Interpretation:

Urbanized and industrial belts lead pollution rankings.

Cleaner cities are often in less urbanized southern or hilly regions.

📌 4. Which pollutants are most prominent across Southern Indian states?
Top 2 pollutants by state:

PM10 and PM2.5 dominate across Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Telangana.

Bottom pollutants:

O₃, NO₂, NH₃, and SO₂ occur less frequently.

Interpretation:

Solid particle pollution (PM10/PM2.5) needs urgent intervention.

Source control (like construction dust, vehicular emissions) is critical.

📌 5. Is there a link between electric vehicle (EV) adoption and AQI improvement?
Insight:

Top 5 EV States (Maharashtra, UP, Karnataka, TN, MP) show AQI ranging 104–108.

Low EV States (e.g., Sikkim, Nagaland, Lakshadweep) also show low AQI (below 105).

Interpretation:

EV adoption alone is not sufficient—must be complemented by broader emission reduction strategies.

Infrastructure and urban planning play a major role.

📌 6. What health issues are most prevalent in polluted states?
Insights (Example):

Bihar: AQI ~157, top diseases: Acute Diarrheal Disease, Food Poisoning

Delhi: AQI ~209, correlates with respiratory illness trends (implied)

Interpretation:

High AQI correlates with higher incidences of waterborne and airborne diseases.

Targeted healthcare investments needed in high-AQI regions.

📌 7. Which brands dominate the air purifier market and how do they differentiate?
Brand	Max Price	Filtration Stages	Noise Level	USP
Dyson	₹50K	4	39 dB	High-end, quiet
Blueair	₹50K	5	33 dB	Maximum coverage
Mi	₹10K	3	38 dB	Budget-friendly

Interpretation:

Market segmentation is clear: premium vs. value vs. performance.

Brands can target regions based on pollution levels and income tiers.

📌 8. Which month records the worst and best air quality?
Monthly AQI Trends:

Worst Months: November (161), December (151), January (125)

Best Months: July (79), August (80)

Interpretation:

Winter smog and stubble burning affect northern states.

Policy actions like banning crop burning and restricting vehicle use in winter months can be beneficial.

📌 9. How do Tier-1, Tier-2, and Tier-3 cities compare on PM2.5 levels?
Insight:

Tier-2 cities have highest cumulative PM2.5.

Tier-1 cities are marginally better, while Tier-3 cities are lowest.

Interpretation:

Tier-2 cities lack air quality control mechanisms present in metros.

These cities should be new targets for air purification infrastructure.

🧠 Summary of Actionable Insights:
Focus Area	Action Recommended
High AQI Cities	Introduce low-emission zones, smart traffic
Southern States Pollutants	Dust control, PM filters on roads
Health Impact	Early warning systems, air quality alerts
EV and AQI Relation	Integrate EV push with green city planning
Purifier Market Strategy	Region-wise targeting of purifier brands

🎤 Final Note:
This dashboard doesn’t just present data—it tells the story of India’s changing air quality and its direct impact on our health, environment, and economy. Let’s act before it’s too late.
